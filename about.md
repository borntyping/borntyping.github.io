I am Sam Clements, an open-sourcerer and [dungeon master][dm].

I currently work as a *IT Consultant* doing Python development at [General Bioinformatics][gb], previously worked as an *Operations Engineer* doing Ruby development at [DataSift][ds] and studied *Open Source Computing* at [Aberystwyth University][au]. I generally work on "devops" projects, writing code in Python, Ruby, Bash and other languages to automate data and software release processes.

Most of this blog's content are posts about [my own open source projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/open-source/), but it also includes technical notes and extremely short pieces of fiction.

You can contact me at [sam@borntyping.co.uk][email], as [@borntyping][twitter] on Twitter, and as [borntyping][github] on Github.
