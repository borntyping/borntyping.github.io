I am Sam Clements, an *Open Source Computing* student at [Aberystwyth University ](http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/) and *Operations Engineer* at [DataSift](http://datasift.com/).

Most of this blog's content are posts about [my own open source projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/open-source/), but it also includes technical notes and minor pieces of fiction.

You can contact me at [sam@borntyping.co.uk](mailto:sam@borntyping.co.uk), as [@borntyping](https://twitter.com/borntyping) on Twitter, and as [borntyping](https://github.com/borntyping) on Github.
