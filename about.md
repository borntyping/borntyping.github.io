I am Sam Clements, an *Open Source Computing* student at [Aberystwyth University ](http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/) and *Operations Industrial Placement Student* at [DataSift](http://datasift.com/).

This blog contains some of my writing (generally short stories and scenes), technical notes and explanations, and [information about some of my open source projects]({{ site.baseurl }}open-source/).

You can contact me at [sam@borntyping.co.uk](mailto:sam@borntyping.co.uk).
