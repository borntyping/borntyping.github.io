A common theme across the tools I use frequently is that they all let me do work faster or with less repetition. I thought I'd list the tools I use a lot and wouldn't want to go without when doing software development.

I've spent a lot of time installing, configuring, and managing my toolkit â€” probably more time than I've saved! However, even if I've not saved any time, I find it a lot easier to both focus and get things right when I can automate something. It's very easy to make mistakes with repetitive tasks, especially if you have to remember a lot of details that aren't relevant to your current goal.

### Daily

I use these tools every single day. They're all very flexible and cover a lot of different use-cases.

- **[Atuin](https://atuin.sh/)**. Store shell history in a sqlite database. I don't use all of it's features, but the interactive UI helps me find commands from my shell history much faster.
- **[Starship](https://starship.rs/)**. Shell prompt system. Keeps important information front-and-center when working in a terminal. I almost exactly replicated my previous zsh configuration, which was hand-built over years. Works in any shell, so I'm not as tied to zsh as I once was.
- **[zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)**. Quickly jump to recent directories. It saves a lot of time not needing to type out full paths or remember where things are when working in a terminal.
- **[Switchbox](https://github.com/borntyping/switchbox)**. My personal git toolbox, used to automate repetitive branch management tasks like rebasing and cleaning up merged branches.
- **[PyCharm Professional](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)**, **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**, and **[Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/)**. I use PyCharm by default as JetBrains code intelligence tools greatly improve my productivity on most codebases. I use VSCode or Micro when I want to edit something quickly.
- **[Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)**. Has a very developer-friendly package ecosystem. Packages are up-to-date, maintained, and usually allow multiple versions of programming languages like Python to be installed side-by-side. Almost everything works out-of-the-box without me having to think about it.

### Weekly

Some of these tools are actually used daily, but I don't really need to think about them very often or actually interact with their configuration.

- **[Direnv](https://direnv.net/)**. Load `.envrc` and `.env` files in the current directory. This makes it really easy to manage environment variables for various projects, without making a mess of my global shell.
- **[Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/)**. Manage Python dependencies. There's lots of options in this space, but Poetry works well for me.
- **[ack](https://beyondgrep.com/)**. Quickly search codebases. Defaults to recursive search and ignoring directories like `.git` or `node_modules`, making it a lot easier to use than `grep`.
- **[gh](https://github.com/cli/cli)**. Automate some common GitHub tasks. I mostly use this to clone repositories quickly. I use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) instead when I need to work with git repositories on Windows machines.

### Monthly

These are tools I use for very specific tasks that I encounter frequently enough that it's still worth making them easier.

- **[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)**. I use Ansible to manage my development machines. It's a lot more flexible than other approaches I've used or seen for managing dotfiles. It's a nice way to abstract over all the different types of packages I need to install.
- **[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)**. Install Python executables in a dedicated space. Keeps the Python tools I use separate from my system installation of Python and separate from codebase-specific virtualenvs.
- **[npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)**. Run NodeJS exectuables without installing them.
- **[aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/)**. Manage AWS credentials. Integrates with your system keyring and issues temporary credentials when needed. Makes it a lot easier to manage lots of different AWS roles.
- **[kubectx + kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)**. Quickly switch between Kubernetes contexts and namespaces. I don't know why this isn't built into the kubectl CLI.
