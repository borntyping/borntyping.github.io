title: Nerf Rough Cut

I got the new Rough Cut 'shotgun' today - I shan't bother with many pictures, as I'm sure most of you will have seen lots of them already.
Instead, I'll show some of the neat features that haven't been talked about.

It's got a pair of small indicators at the back of the blaster, showing whether the blaster is loaded - one indicator for each side, as you can (with a little difficultly) fire single darts, and priming the blaster primes two chambers/springs/whatever (I've not looked at the internals).

As well as just having two chambers, instead of firing row-by-row, the blaster will always fire the highest dart from each side, regardless of which row it's on. However, it doesn't fire unless the darts are pushed all the way in.

The blaster is also a little wider than most of the pictures show, but the build is pretty nice, and quite easy to spin around! The slamfire also works better than I expected, firing 8 darts in just a couple of seconds.
