I finally managed to get my hands on a Nerf Firestrike today! (*Asda, Â£8.99*)

Its pretty good looking, on both sides. Feels about as rugged as it looks, which is nice.

The priming handle sticks about a bit, though not nearly as much as the previous version. Its also a bit thicker. The darts fit in quite securely - shaking the gun vigorously did nothing to make them fall out - and the shape of the muzzle makes it very easy to load.

The trigger is surprisingly smooth, with a short, effortless pull. Its extremely quiet - the mechanism buffers the plunger, avoiding any loud clicking sounds or such. Almost all of the sound is a pop as the air escapes.

And finally, a size comparison with the Retaliator:

Its around the same size as a Scout, and while the build appears quite bulky and rugged, the overall size is somewhat more compact.

It also has a laser sight - while certainly not a laser, its much brighter than the lights seen in previous blasters such as the Deploy, to the point where it might actually be useful at close range. It has a smaller trigger under the main one for this, which is easily turned on by simply grasping the handle tightly.
