title: Void at Show and Tell
---

Last night I attended the [BCS Mid-Wales 'Show and Tell' event](http://midwales.bcs.org/show-and-tell-events/), and presented some of my ideas for **Void**, an open source space game.

The talks were recorded, and so here's the talk I gave *([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPymLNQD0eE&feature=player_embedded#t=5872s))*:

The original notes for the talk can be found [here](http://blog.borntyping.co.uk/blog/2012/11/23/void/).

Again - if you're intrested in the project:

- Find some of the current design notes at [github.com/borntyping/void](https://github.com/borntyping/void)
- Contact me with your opinions on the project - details for finding me can be found on [my homepage](http://borntyping.co.uk)
- Join `#os` on `AFNet` ([irc.aberwiki.org](irc://irc.aberwiki.org)), a hub for a few other Open Source projects in Aberystwyth, including [James' Ravencrofts `pytentd`](https://github.com/ravenscroftj/pytentd)
