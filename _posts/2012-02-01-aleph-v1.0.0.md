A published, working version of the Aleph IRC library is now available. While there are plenty of features not yet implemented, it should now be possible to use it to implement a simple (or complex) IRC bot.

An example of a bot that logs all incoming messages:

    :::python
    #!/usr/bin/python

    from aleph.core import Core
    from aleph import logger

    class AlephTestBot (Core):
        def input (self, message):
            # Log the message
            logger.log(message, 6, message.command)

    bot = Aleph({
        'nick' : 'AlephExampleBot',

        'servers' : [{
            'id': 'IrcNet',
            'address': 'server',
            'channels': ['#aleph']
        }],
    }).run()

Features I hope to add in the near future include:

- A callback interface, so functions can be registered to message types - this will become the default instance of an Aleph bot and will be significantly easier to build a bot with.
- Better understanding of the irc protocol on the part of the IrcServer class, including things such as reading the MOTD and other data.
- Documentation that does not rely on looking at the source code.
