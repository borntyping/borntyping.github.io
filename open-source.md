These are the Open Source projects that I have written and maintain. The majority of these projects use GitHub's issue tracker - bug reports and feature requests are welcome on any of these projects. If you do not have a GitHub account, or otherwise need to contact me, you can email me at [sam@borntyping.co.uk](mailto:sam@borntyping.co.uk).
