These are the Open Source projects that I have written and maintain. The majority of these projects use GitHub's issue tracker - bug reports and feature requests are welcome on any of these projects. If you do not have a GitHub account, or otherwise need to contact me, you can email me at [sam@borntyping.co.uk](mailto:sam@borntyping.co.uk). More information on the status of these projects can be found on my [status page](http://docs.borntyping.io/en/latest/status.html).

## Contributions

These are some of the projects I have contributed to:

* [Supervisor](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/) - documentation fixes
* [Supervisor (cookbook)](https://github.com/poise/supervisor) - CentOS support
* [riemann-dash](https://github.com/aphyr/riemann-dash) - show event states, fix log view
* [knife-axe](https://github.com/faja/knife-axe) - help improve initial version

Several of my above projects were built specifically for [DataSift](http://datasift.com/) while I worked there:

* [Supermann](https://github.com/borntyping/supermann) - drop in monitoring for processes running under Supervisor
* [Mannhunter](https://github.com/borntyping/mannhunter) - memory limiting tool, providing functionality that Supervisor did not
* [riemann-client](https://github.com/borntyping/python-riemann-client) - accessible command line tool for Riemann
* [Sous-chef](https://github.com/borntyping/sous-chef) - used to provide information to developers without access to chef
* [alternate_search](https://github.com/borntyping/cookbook-alternate_search) - used to make Chef search easier and safer to use
* [csdl](https://github.com/borntyping/python-csdl) - built at a hackday as an experiment in higher-level constructs for CSDL
