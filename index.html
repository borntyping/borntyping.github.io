<div class="post">
  <h1 class="post-title">{{ page.title }}</h1>

  I am Sam Clements, an open-sourcerer and dungeon master.

  I currently work as an _Automation Engineer_ at [InfoSum][is].
  I've previously worked as a *IT Consultant* doing Python development at [General Bioinformatics][gb] and as an *Operations Engineer* doing Ruby development at [DataSift][ds].
  I studied *Open Source Computing* at [Aberystwyth University][au].
  I generally work on "DevOps" projects, writing code in Python, Ruby, Bash and other languages to automate data and software release processes.

  Most of this blog's content are posts about [my own open source projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/open-source/), but it also includes technical notes, D&D guides and extremely short fiction.

  You can contact me at [sam@borntyping.co.uk][email], as [@borntyping][twitter] on Twitter, and as [borntyping][github] on Github.
