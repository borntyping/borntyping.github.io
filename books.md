I've avoided including many extremely well known works in this list in the hopes of it remaining useful as a list of new books or media to try - for example, I've not included _Lord of the Rings_ or _The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy_.

Books and media highlighted in bold are the best of this list, and I've only bolded fiction that is not only excellent but was in some way influential to me (not life-changing or eye-opening, but deeply interesting to me). Content marked with a &#9888; contains content that may be distressing (beyond that which you might normally find in fiction.)
