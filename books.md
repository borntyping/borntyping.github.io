title: Book recommendations

Books and media highlighted in bold are the best of this list.
They appear in order of preference, while other entries on this list are sorted alphabetically.
Only the first book in a series is listed, except for special cases, but the entire series usually carries the same recommendation.

I've avoided including well known works in this list in the hopes of it remaining useful as a list of new books and media to recommend to friends.

Content marked with a † contains content that may be distressing, beyond that which you might normally find in fantasy or science fiction.
