Books and media highlighted in bold are the best of this list.
They appear in order of preference, while other entries on this list are sorted alphabetically.
Only the first book in a series is listed, except for special cases, but the entire series usually carries the same recommendation.

Content marked with a ◊ contains content that may be distressing, beyond that which you might normally find in average fantasy or science fiction books.
